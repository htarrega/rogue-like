## Contribution guide 

### Pull Requests

PRs to our project are always welcome and can be a quick way to get your fix or improvement slated for the next version. In general, PRs should:

- Only fix/add the functionality in question **OR** address style problems of the code.
- Add unit or integration tests for fixed or changed functionality (if a test suite already exists).
- Address a single concern in the least number of changed lines as possible.
- Include documentation in the repo.

For changes that address core functionality or would require breaking changes (e.g. a major release), it's best to open an Issue to discuss your proposal first. This is not required but can save time creating and reviewing changes.
